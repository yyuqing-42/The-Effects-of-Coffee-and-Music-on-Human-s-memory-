# The-Effects-of-Coffee-and-Music-on-Human-s-memory-

Conducted a two-way randomized block design to study the potential effects of coffee and music on human's memory

## Research Question

Do coffee and music affect human memory?

## Experimental Design

Two-Way Randomized Block Design with a 198 smaple size and 0.8 power

## Variables Considered

Response: Difference in time taken to complete memory game before and after receiving treatment 

Factors: 
- Type of music (Classical, Heavy Metal, No music)
- Amount of coffee (1 cup, 2 cups, 3 cups)

Block: Gender

Uncontrollable: Health conditionos, Previous coffee drinking habits

## Data Analysis

The statistical analysis we used is an ANOVA analysis using R. We measured the significance of the F-value outputted by the ANOVA table to determine if there is signifiance in the treatments, block, and interaction. 

For data visualization, we used boxplots to compare the difference in time taken to complete the memory game and gender, coffee dose and music genre. We also used interaction plot of coffee dose and music genre with the difference in time taken to complete memory games. Lastly, we ran the residual diagnostic plots for ANOVA test. 

## Conclusion

- Given the ANOVA results and visualized through our interation plots and boxplots, we conclude that music appears to affect memory performance, while we do not have evidence to suggest that coffee affects memory or that there is interaction between music and coffee. 

- From the music genre boxplot, it appears that the siginificanxe xomes rom a decreased memory performance when listening to heavy mental music. 

- This means that while working in a busy office, we suggest that people avoid listening to heavy metal music and other music in similar genres such as hard rock. 

## Future study

- Our experiment could be improved by increasing the sample size and the corresponding power. 

- To further our study, future research questions would look to expand the range of coffee dosage and the range of music categories investigated.
