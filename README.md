Conducted a two-way randomized block design to study the potential effects of coffee and music on human's memory

## Research Question

Do coffee and music affect human memory?


As coffee and music become increasingly common in the workplace, it is important to see how they might affect employee work performance and productivity. Many studies show the beneficial effects of caffeine on cognitive function and memory. Studies also show that music can enhance the attention and memory centers of the brain.

The results of this study may provide insight on how employers should provide employees with accommodations.

## Experimental Design

Two-Way Randomized Block Design with a 198 smaple size, a 0.25 effect size, and a 0.8 power.

## Participants

The virtual participants of our study are sampled from an online website called The Island. We will be blocking our participants by gender since existing literature suggests that there are gender differences in memory. We chose to make age a held-constant factor as our objective is to figure out the effect of combining coffee and music on working adults. We will select participants who are in their 30s because they are very likely to have a steady job. For this study, the participants are all from the Island which is somewhere in the Pacific ocean, close to Australia.

## Variables Considered

Response: Difference in time taken to complete memory game before and after receiving treatment 

Factors: 
- Type of music (Classical, Heavy Metal, No music)
- Amount of coffee (1 cup, 2 cups, 3 cups)

Block: Gender

Uncontrollable: Health conditionos, Previous coffee drinking habits

## Data Analysis

The statistical analysis we used is an ANOVA analysis using R. We measured the significance of the F-value outputted by the ANOVA table to determine if there is signifiance in the treatments, block, and interaction. 

For data visualization, we used boxplots to compare the difference in time taken to complete the memory game and gender, coffee dose and music genre. We also used interaction plot of coffee dose and music genre with the difference in time taken to complete memory games. Lastly, we ran the residual diagnostic plots for ANOVA test. 

## Conclusion

- Given the ANOVA results and visualized through our interation plots and boxplots, we conclude that music appears to affect memory performance, while we do not have evidence to suggest that coffee affects memory or that there is interaction between music and coffee. 

- From the music genre boxplot, it appears that the siginificance xomes rom a decreased memory performance when listening to heavy mental music. 

- This means that while working in a busy office, we suggest that people avoid listening to heavy metal music and other music in similar genres such as hard rock. 

## Future study

- Our experiment could be improved by increasing the sample size and the corresponding power. 

- To further our study, future research questions would look to expand the range of coffee dosage and the range of music categories investigated.
